##It all started with a Craigslist ad&hellip;
  
No, not that section of Craigslist. In the summer of 2009, Mike was looking for a new roommate to share his Cobble Hill apartment. Em knew very little about Brooklyn, but reasoned that Cobble Hill "sounded cute," so she answered Mike's ad.
  
> I don't know, Lucy, I think she may be the one.

Their first meeting was magical. Actually, it was predictably awkward. But when they parted ways, Mike knew that Em was the right person to share the apartment. Little did he know, they would wind up sharing their lives together.

As roommates, Em and Mike clicked right away. They shared coffee in the morning, took Lucy on walks together, and reminisced about growing up in New Jersey. A few months into living together, they had their first kiss- which apparently everyone they knew had already predicted.

> "Is your roommate cute?" "Yeah!" "Are you going to set him up with any of us?" "Um...no."

Over the next five years, they turned their little apartment into a home. There's been graduate school, new jobs, fire escape gardens, and countless Saturdays at the dog park. They've become a part of each other's families and gained new friends. And since the beginning, both Em and Mike knew this was something special.
